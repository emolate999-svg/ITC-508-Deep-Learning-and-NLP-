# 🧠 NLP Model Fine-Tuning Exercise

This repository contains the implementation and experimentation workflow for fine-tuning an NLP model using Google Colab, hyperparameter tuning, and reporting in IEEE format.

---

## 📌 Objectives

This exercise aims to:

* Convert the provided fine-tuning script into a structured Google Colab notebook with detailed documentation.
* Run at least three hyperparameter experiments to maximize model performance (F1-Score).
* Utilize **GridSearch or RandomSearch (Exercise F3)** to efficiently explore hyperparameter combinations for improved fine-tuning.
* Present the analysis and results in an IEEE-formatted report.

---

## 🗂 Notebook Structure

The Google Colab notebook is required to follow this sequence:

1. **Setup & Data Preparation**
2. **Load Pre-trained Model & Tokenizer**
3. **Training Configuration & Trainer Initialization**
4. **Model Finetuning & Saving**
5. **Inference Process / Model Testing**

Each code cell must include a markdown cell explaining the **function of every line of code**.

---

## 🔬 Hyperparameter Experiments (F2)

* Each member is assigned **at least 3 hyperparameters** to tune.
* Metrics to record: **F1-Score and Accuracy** for every run.
* Results must be documented in an **Excel experiment log sheet**.

---

## 🔎 Exercise F3 — GridSearch / RandomSearch

To enhance the fine-tuning process:

* Apply **GridSearch** or **RandomSearch** techniques to explore hyperparameter combinations.
* Identify the **best model configuration** based on performance on the evaluation dataset.

---

## 📝 Report Requirements

A **short IEEE-formatted report** must summarize:

* Baseline model performance
* Hyperparameter tuning results
* GridSearch/RandomSearch outcomes
* Final optimal configuration
